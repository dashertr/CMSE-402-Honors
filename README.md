# Seaborn Visualization Tutorial 

This repository contains a complete, tutorial-style project developed for my CMSE 402 Honors Option. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Seaborn can be used to improve the clarity, accessibility, and analytical power of data visualizations.

## Contents

- `Seaborn_Tutorial.ipynb`:  
  The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full tutorial. It includes multiple plots that are progressively improved using Seaborn features, along with explanations grounded in principles from Edward Tufte, Alberto Cairo, and key course takeaways.

- `penguins.csv`:  
  The dataset used in the tutorial, containing biological measurements of three penguin species. 

- `/plots`:  
  A folder containing exported `.png` images of each plot, both in their default and improved forms.

## Tutorial Highlights

- Use of Seaborn's `hue`, `size`, and `style` to encode multivariate relationships
- Colorblind-safe and perceptually uniform palettes for accessibility
- Masking, annotation, and colormap selection in correlation heatmaps
- Comparison of default vs. improved plots, with explanations of visual reasoning
- Reflections on course principles like data-ink ratio, chartjunk reduction, and multivariate encoding

## Learning Goals

This project demonstrates not only how to use Seaborn technically, but how to use it **intentionally** - applying core ideas from data visualization theory to make plots more effective, inclusive, and insightful.
